<h3>WHY A QUEST DESGINER?</h3>
This is because the intersection of <strong>favorite and good areas</strong> is the quest planner.
<br><br>When I was in school, I was just a game user. However, after entering university, I gradually changed from user to planner through various activities such as
<br>1) <u>planning and producing podcasts</u>
<br>2) <u>participating in game clubs in school</u>
<br>3) <u>participating in Gyeongbuk game jam and global game jam</u>
<br>4) <u>operating a number of communities related to MMORPG-oriented market research and subculture in Chinese game company Changyu</u>
<br>5) <u>working as a quest scenario designer for 1 years.</u>
<br><br>These various practical and collaborative experiences based on my hobby became an opportunity to be convinced that there is a game designer, especially a quest designer, in the common denominator of my favorite and best field
