<h3>WHY A QUEST DESGINER?</h3>
This is because the intersection of <strong>favorite and good areas</strong> is the quest planner.
<br><br>When I was in school, I was just a game user. However, after entering university, I gradually changed from user to planner through various activities such as
<br>1) <u>planning and producing podcasts</u>
<br>2) <u>participating in game clubs in school</u>
<br>3) <u>participating in Gyeongbuk game jam and global game jam</u>
<br>4) <u>operating a number of communities related to MMORPG-oriented market research and subculture in Chinese game company Changyu</u>
<br>5) <u>working as a quest scenario designer for 1 years.</u>
<br><br>These various practical and collaborative experiences based on my hobby became an opportunity to be convinced that there is a game designer, especially a quest designer, in the common denominator of my favorite and best field

<h3>Healer!</h3>
I am outspoken in making opinions, but I have a careful habit of analyzing, contemplating, and quantifying on my own until I come up with them.
<br><br>In particular, I was able to develop important communication-related capabilities for planners because I played a role in coordinating, compromising, and persuading various opinions in the important decision-making process
<br><br>For example, team members who have no knowledge of games in school projects and completed plans are still used as best practices for classes years later.
<br><br>In addition, through the feedback on schedule management and work speed received from the team members in the first game jam, we were able to produce a more complete 2D adventure game unlike before when we made a game that was rarely played by ensuring that the team members communicated in the second game jam.
<br><br>As such, my obsessively meticulous side gradually moved toward growing together in harmony with my team members, not just by myself
<br><br>Based on these experiences, I realized that when I was put into practice, the experience I had so far was not all.
<br><br>However, when I used the conflict as an opportunity to prove myself to my team members, an atmosphere within the team was formed to encourage each other.
<br><br>Thus, I was able to improve the quality of my work by maintaining a strong relationship based on trust with my colleagues who reached out to me before I even asked.
<br><br>Eventually, I received positive reviews from my teammates and colleagues in the collaboration department as a colleague who wants to work with me, a fast-growing colleague, a colleague who has no bad habits and can trust and do anything, and a colleague who does things passionately and greedily.
<br><br>Looking at my tendencies, I can say that I am a party healer within the group. The meticulous and persistent nature of looking at the forest from a distance and not missing even a small tree enables fast, accurate, and insightful sharing of situations and conveying opinions to team members.
<br><br>Basically, he has a high affinity and has no qualms about communicating with people, so he always approaches first, but he takes care of what the other person needs and makes the other person want to give me what I need first.
<br><br>I think a warm and encouraging team is the ideal team. At the same time, I don't think there should be any hesitation in presenting opinions. Based on these ideas, I was able to grow into a planner with the ability of a healer
